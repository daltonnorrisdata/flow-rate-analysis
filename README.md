Flow Rate Surge Analysis – Storm Event Detection

This project analyzes rapid stormwater response in infrastructure using flow rate and rainfall data collected near Bear Creek South (Golf Course). The analysis highlights sudden surges in flow caused by a rainfall event, showcasing the erosion and flash flood risks associated with development-induced runoff.

Key Objectives

- Monitor flow rate response to rainfall
- Detect storm-driven surges and calculate peak metrics
- Identify high-risk flow increase events based on rate-of-rise and percent change
- Visualize storm impact and erosion risk with annotated time-series plots

Features

- **Storm Event Detection** – Peak flow of 998.4 CFS detected within 5 hours of 1.22 inches of rainfall.
- **Rate of Rise Analysis** – Calculated peak rate of rise at +40.91 CFS over a 5-minute period.
- **Percent Flow Increase** – Maximum increase of +14.6% detected within 15 minutes.
- **Anomaly Annotation** – Key timestamps and flow shifts highlighted with contextual labels.
- **Visual Summary** – Layered plots for rainfall, flow rate, and intensity class.

Tools Used

- **Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)** – Data processing and plotting
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive environment for time-series and event annotation
- **Custom logic** – Threshold-based detection of surge intensity levels (e.g., high, extreme)
